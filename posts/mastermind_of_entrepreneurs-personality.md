# Mastermind of Enterpreneurs - Personality
What common attributes we can see in successful enterpreneurs? What is the core of enterpreneur mastermind?

Think about your mind and your brain in terms of energy. After a long day at work you feel tired, your energy is depleated => you need to charge your brain before you can produce (give away). Note.: In physics, the law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constantâ€”it is said to be conserved over time. -- no new energy can be created, we can only transform already existing energy.

## 3 Pillars of Enterpreneur's Mastermind
### 1 - Vitality (of mind)
#### Adapt
According to Darwin's theory of evolution the most successful are those who can **adapt** - adapting is key to success.
#### Hormones and your mind
Be aware of **levels of cortisol and testosterone** hormons in your body. *Cortisol*, often refered to as *stress hormone* is produced by our bodies when we don't get enough sleep or if we are in stressful times or environment. Together with adrenaline *cortisol* helps your body overcome survival challenges. However you want to **avoid high cortisol levels** because it makes your brain operate in Fight of Flight mode (our reptilian brain, limited cognitive function). *Testosterone* on other hand, stimulates frontal cortex (critical thinking, planning, reason) and makes you realxed and decisive. Frequently check yourself, your body. Try to *ground* your energy. Be always relaxed enough to be able to laugh. Your diaphragm should not be tense. Breathe into your stomach. Calm down, be master of your mind and energy.
### 2 - Power (of mind)
#### Facts are power
Separate facts from knowledge. 1 + 1 = 2, Nixon was a US president, Earth is orbitted by one moon - these are facts. We like facts, **facts help us make informed decisions**. Opinions, stories, all the information laying around the internet...is knowledge. Mine knowledge for facts, separate facts from knowledge.
#### Structure
The last part of brain we deloped was frontal cortex (that's where planning, reason and critical thinking is). Realise that and use it. Plan, organise, structure. Use your evolutional advantage to its maximum. It is great to have creative ideas and be in the flow (typical for artists), but without a structure and regime you won't ever make it real, you will not get it done. Embrace structure and routine as friends that help you achieve your goals step by step.
#### Failure
A lot has been said about embracing failure in Enterpreneur community. I'll repeat following:
- Don't be afraid to be wrong (opposite of what they teach in schools, where to be wrong is the worst you could do). Don't be afraid to be wrong - it is key to creativity.
- If you failed and learned from it, you profited.

### 3 Cooperation (of minds)
#### Personality
It is crucial to be positive, agreeable person. See other peoples qualities, be supportive. The way you think about others **resonates** with them. Have happy, outgoing, positive, **attractive**, **agreeable** personality - this way you attract people, bussiness and stimulate growth of your bussiness.
#### Multiple minds
Your mind is combinantion of creative mind, structured logical thinking, survival instincts, subconciousness and intuition. Recognise that, try to use every mind for this designed purpose.
#### Mindsets
Try to help others, be supportive, imagine what would your hero person do in your situation, build relationship on trust, trust your intuition.
